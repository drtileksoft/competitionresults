# Suggested Improvements

The codebase already covers a wide range of competition scenarios. Based on a quick review, here are a few ideas for further improvements:

- **Reduce duplicate data loading in result aggregation.** `ResultService.GetResultsTotalAsync` currently loads and ranks every discipline sequentially. Caching ranked discipline results during medal calculations or projecting only the properties required for the totals could substantially cut down on database round-trips.
- **Centralise ranking logic.** Several parts of `ResultService` reorder results with similar criteria. Extracting a shared helper for ordering and tie-resolution would make changes to ranking rules easier to test and reason about.
- **Expand defensive checks on user-supplied data.** The new null-handling for thrower nationalities avoids runtime exceptions when optional profile fields are left blank. Applying the same idea to club names, emails, or optional translations would harden the application against partially filled registrations.
- **Add integration tests for notification workflows.** Methods such as `FillRandomScoresAsync` and `UpdateScoresAsync` notify the `NotificationHub`. Verifying that these notifications fire in key scenarios would protect real-time updates as future refactors land.
- **Document data import expectations.** A short guide describing expected CSV formats or admin workflows for bulk result entry would help future maintainers reproduce the seeded data locally without reverse-engineering the migrations.

## Further opportunities spotted during a deeper review

- **Batch writes instead of per-row lookups in data services.** Methods such as `DeleteResultsAsync`, `FillRandomScoresAsync`, `SaveBullseyeEntriesAsync`, and `UpdateScoresAsync` query the database inside tight loops, creating dozens of round-trips for larger competitions. Reading the relevant results up front (e.g., via `ToDictionaryAsync`) and updating them in-memory before a single `SaveChangesAsync` call—or leveraging EF Core's `ExecuteDeleteAsync`/`ExecuteUpdateAsync` helpers—would dramatically reduce latency and the chance of inconsistent state. 【F:CompetitionResults/Data/ResultService.cs†L397-L528】
- **Harden competition-wide aggregations.** `GetMedalsByNationAsync` calls `GetResultsByDisciplineAsync` inside a loop, which itself rebuilds discipline rankings from the database each time. Building the discipline results once per request or caching the ranked projections for the duration of the aggregation would avoid repeated work and keep medal counts fast enough for live dashboards. 【F:CompetitionResults/Data/ResultService.cs†L533-L610】
- **Support cancellation tokens in asynchronous APIs.** None of the data-service methods accept a `CancellationToken`, which means UI-driven operations cannot be aborted when a user navigates away. Threading the token from controllers/components into the EF Core queries would improve responsiveness under load. 【F:CompetitionResults/Data/ResultService.cs†L20-L676】
- **Guard against missing category assignments.** `BuildDisciplineResults` assumes every thrower has a `CategoryId`, but `Thrower.CategoryId` is nullable in the entity. Adding a null check (and surfacing an admin-facing warning) would prevent the service from throwing when a thrower is created without a category. 【F:CompetitionResults/Data/ResultService.cs†L240-L320】
- **Make DTO rendering logic testable.** `ResultDto.BackgroundColor` encodes presentation rules directly in the DTO. Extracting this logic into a dedicated formatter (or Razor component helper) would let unit tests assert medal/tie styling without instantiating UI components. 【F:CompetitionResults/Data/ResultService.cs†L641-L676】

These suggestions are intentionally scoped so they can be iteratively adopted without large architectural changes.
