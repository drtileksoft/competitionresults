# Suggested Improvements

The codebase already covers a wide range of competition scenarios. Based on a quick review, here are a few ideas for further improvements:

- **Reduce duplicate data loading in result aggregation.** `ResultService.GetResultsTotalAsync` currently loads and ranks every discipline sequentially. Caching ranked discipline results during medal calculations or projecting only the properties required for the totals could substantially cut down on database round-trips.
- **Centralise ranking logic.** Several parts of `ResultService` reorder results with similar criteria. Extracting a shared helper for ordering and tie-resolution would make changes to ranking rules easier to test and reason about.
- **Expand defensive checks on user-supplied data.** The new null-handling for thrower nationalities avoids runtime exceptions when optional profile fields are left blank. Applying the same idea to club names, emails, or optional translations would harden the application against partially filled registrations.
- **Add integration tests for notification workflows.** Methods such as `FillRandomScoresAsync` and `UpdateScoresAsync` notify the `NotificationHub`. Verifying that these notifications fire in key scenarios would protect real-time updates as future refactors land.
- **Document data import expectations.** A short guide describing expected CSV formats or admin workflows for bulk result entry would help future maintainers reproduce the seeded data locally without reverse-engineering the migrations.

These suggestions are intentionally scoped so they can be iteratively adopted without large architectural changes.
